        "content": "Extreme weather events could displace millions of children over the next three decades, according to a new report from UNICEF. The that 43.1 million child displacements over the past six years, or 20,000 child displacements per day, were linked to weather-related disasters. Most of the displacements were driven by flooding and storms, and children from the Philippines, India and China were most affected by these displacements. “In addition to their locations and geographic profiles being prone to floods and storms, these countries’ sizes and populations also help explain the large number of displacements,” UNICEF found. Droughts caused more than 1.3 million displacements across 15 countries. More than half the drought-related displacements occurred in Somalia, Ethiopia and Afghanistan. “slow-onset displacements due to events like droughts” are likely highly underreported because there’s no global estimation associated with future events like droughts. Wildfires were the third-largest weather event to displace children around the world. The United States, Canada and Israel, “which all have robust early warning and DRR [disaster risk reduction] systems,” all reported the most children uprooted due to wildfires. On average, island developing states and countries in the Horn of Africa have experienced the greatest proportion of their child population displaced over the past six years. Dominica, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, the Northern Mariana Islands, Cuba and Vanuatu recorded the most child displacements relative to their populations. Researchers warn that the number of displacements will only increase as climate change creates stronger weather effects, uprooting people across the globe from their homes. “As the impacts of climate change escalate, so too will climate-driven movement. We have the tools and knowledge to respond to this escalating challenge for children, but we are acting far too slowly,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell . “We need to strengthen efforts to prepare communities, protect children at risk of displacement, and support those already uprooted.”",

        "content": "Google 's new Magnifier app, which it showed off at the Google Pixel 8 launch event , is making its way to the Play Store for you to download and use right now if you have one of the more recent best Pixel phones – and it doesn't to be the new Google Pixel 8 or Google Pixel 8 Pro (although it's not available on the Pixel Fold at the moment). The main purpose of the Magnifier app is, as the name suggests, to magnify things in your day-to-day life. Can’t read the date on your carton of eggs? The app can make it larger for you. Is that over-the-counter menu too far away to read? The app can help you zoom in on it and show you everything that’s on offer. But it goes further than just making text larger, with a few handy extra features that make it more than a simplified camera app. Firstly, there’s the flashlight control. Rather than simply turning your phone’s torch on or off, this feature allows you to tune its brightness – so, for example, you won’t need to shine a bright light in a dim restaurant when you only need a little illumination to read the menu. There are also helpful adjustments that you can use to make signs more legible. Tap the settings icon at the bottom-left of the screen and you’ll open up a range of options for altering the live feed of what the Magnifier app sees. Filters allow you to alter the color of the text and background it’s written on. The options are Inverted, Grayscale, Grayscale Inverted, and then either red, yellow, or blue text on a white or black background, plus the reverse of these options (white or black text on a blue, yellow, or red background). You can also adjust the contrast and brightness of the image feed by tapping on different tabs in the adjustments menu. Lastly, the Magnifier app has Google Lens built in, so you can copy, listen to, and use Google Search for the text that you highlight on the image you’ve magnified. The Magnifier app is nothing mind-blowing by any stretch, but we can see it being a handy tool for anyone with a Pixel phone; and even if you don’t feel you need the app, it could be a handy one to have installed to lend a hand to a family member or friend. To download and use the new Magnifier app you’ll need to be using a Google Pixel 5 or later according to the app’s page – the Google Pixel Fold and Google Pixel Tablet also aren’t supported right now. You can look for it in the Play Store by searching for 'Magnifier' and downloading the app of the same name created by Google LLC – the icon is a simple white magnifying glass hovering over a gray square on a blue background.",

        "description": "From time management to conflict resolution, a new class at Miles Community College seeks to hone interpersonal skills at the high school level.",
        "content": "Until this fall, Terry High School junior Hatty Eaton hadn’t given a lot of thought to becoming a teacher. But when she completed a survey of her interests and prospective career choices the first week of the semester, teaching rose to the top of the list of jobs that might fit her. The timing of that recommendation was fitting, too, as Eaton had signed on to work as a teacher’s aide at the local elementary school. “I took that survey, and it gave me teaching careers,” Eaton told Montana Free Press this week. “That kind of made me more sure that that could be a possibility for something for me to do.” Eaton was one of 19 Terry juniors and seniors to take the survey this fall — their first assignment in a free dual-credit class that Miles Community College in Miles City is piping remotely into high schools throughout eastern Montana. From there students will pivot to lessons about time management, professional behavior and resolving conflict in the workplace, all culminating in an end-of-year mock interview with MCC staff for a job of the student’s choosing. MCC Dean of Student Engagement Richard DeShields, who developed and teaches the course, said the focus on so-called “soft skills” is designed to not only get students thinking about their futures but to help them become more well-rounded employees. “When we talk about the trades or we talk about technology or we talk about actual careers, it’s the technical skills that we still focus on,” DeShields said. “We’re trying to teach a skill and navigate all of those pieces, and sometimes we forget these other components.” Miles Community College first launched the course among its freshmen in fall 2022, in part, DeShields said, to help student-athletes and others better identify an area of study that aligns with their interests. According to MCC President Ron Slinger, the course was popular enough that he began pitching it to area high schools, with Terry High School and Jordan’s Garfield County High School signing on as pilot sites for the spring of 2023. This fall, the number of participating districts climbed to 15, and the campus through the Montana Community Foundation to support its efforts in July. Slinger added that MCC is giving a presentation on its initiative at the Association of Community College Trustees’ annual conference in Las Vegas in October. “I think a lot of it is coming out of the pandemic especially — we know this with adults, but also with high school students — people were sheltered, they didn’t interact with each other,” Slinger said of the course’s appeal. “They’re stymied in these skills of conflict resolution, how to treat each other respectfully, how to respond appropriately, all these things.” For Slinger, adding a one-credit class on soft skills to Montana’s already extensive patchwork of is also a way to address a key concern Montana employers have identified in the workforce. According to a conducted by the Montana Chamber Foundation, 80% of respondents indicated that “workforce readiness skills” should be a required component of public school curriculum. The survey results also listed a lack of interpersonal skills as the second biggest challenge to business growth in the state. Montana Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Todd O’Hair acknowledged that those challenges aren’t necessarily new. But, he said, he and his staff hear from businesses “almost daily” about their continued struggles dealing with basic workplace issues: what to do about an employee who doesn’t dress appropriately, doesn’t understand what a full work week looks like, doesn’t know how to address customers or know the significance of a handshake. Reinforcing those skills at an early age is something O’Hair believes Montana “needs to focus on.” “I don’t know where the root of that derives,” O’Hair said. “I don’t know if that’s because we’re increasingly a social media-driven society or what it is. But some of those basic soft skills seem to really be lacking. And we’re hearing it with employers that are saying those sort of things, whether they’re hiring a graduate from a four-year university or someone that’s coming right out of high school.” The concept isn’t particularly foreign to public school leaders either. In Lewistown, school superintendent Thom Peck said instruction on certain aspects of career development — namely crafting resumes and interviewing for jobs — was already available for disadvantaged students or students with special needs. However, Peck noted that staff and funding limitations prevented Fergus High School in that town from expanding such instruction to the rest of the student body. Partnering with MCC to host its course removes those barriers, Peck continued, and will hopefully give students “a leg up on increasing their employability.” “It’s very similar to what we were already doing,” Peck said. “But now it’s reaching a larger, broader group of kids.” Peck added that the course dovetails with efforts by Montana agencies to bolster resources for public school students, including services offered statewide by the Department of Labor and Industry and the Office of Public Instruction’s recent hiring of . Fergus, one of the latest additions to MCC’s list of participating schools, will start the course as an elective for seniors next spring. In Jordan, school superintendent Nate Olson said enrollment is now mandatory for all seniors. Terry K-12 principal Paige Denny said her district started last spring with seniors but is now transitioning the class to a junior-level requirement. She sees that switch as offering students another year to “hone those skills and utilize them” as they fill out college and scholarship applications, send out resumes or go straight into the workforce. Before students complete the course, they’re required to write a job description in a field they’re interested in and conduct a mock interview with MCC instructors for that position. DeShields said the questions he poses in those interviews are specifically designed to gauge the soft skills they’ve studied. “Let’s say that someone is going into graphic design; we may ask a question about responding to customers a little differently. It might be something that would focus on how they seek opinions to create a marketing or graphic campaign because that’s working with a customer,” DeShields said. “Or they might say [they’re going into] cosmetology. So then it’s like, ‘Well, how do you meet a customer that comes in and they didn’t like the way that you cut their hair?’” Slinger’s goal is to expand the career development and interpersonal skills course to all 40 school districts in eastern Montana — a goal, he said, that could as much as double MCC’s total student headcount, but one that carries its own challenges, including training enough instructors. “We’re this close to having [district] number 18,” Slinger said in a recent interview, his hand raised with a small gap between his finger and thumb. “And number 18 is a larger school. It’s one thing when you’re Rosebud or you’re Plevna or you’re Hysham where you only have a small handful of students. You could just go to them and say, ‘You seven are taking this class.’ When the school has 100, 200 students, it’s not as easy to do that.” As a high school junior, Eaton said not many of her peers are gearing up to enter the workforce full-time in the immediate future. But even early in the semester, she continued, she does see a lot of value in the lessons offered by MCC, even when it comes to non-work-related tasks like preparing for tests. Part of the class requires students to personally reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and identify specific skills they need to improve, which Eaton suggested helps enforce a broader underlying ability to self-critique. “Especially with the reflections, you see, ‘Oh, maybe I need to work more on my time management, or maybe I need to work on being more trustworthy,’” Eaton said. “You can really evaluate yourself better.”",

        "description": "A freshly leaked benchmark for super-efficient Lunar Lake processors from Intel is causing a stir.",
        "content": "Intel ’s Lunar Lake processors have been somewhat under the radar thus far, so it’s interesting to see a leak pop up around the future CPUs. As a quick refresher – the various lakes Intel employs are confusingly numerous – the next-gen chips from Intel are Meteor Lake (laptop chips, due in December ) and Raptor Lake Refresh (desktop, strongly rumored to be launching this month , but we don’t have official word on that). Intel’s following launches after those chips are Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake, with the former covering desktop territory (and also laptops), but the latter will be mobile processors for notebooks only. Specifically, Lunar Lake is focused really tightly on obtaining excellent power efficiency to benefit laptops and battery life, sipping power very frugally indeed. So, with all that in mind, the leaked Lunar Lake CPU was spotted in the SiSoftware Sandra benchmark suite as flagged up by Everest on X (formerly Twitter). LNLhttps://t.co/F3raD68swU October 4, 2023 The actual benchmark result at this point doesn’t really tell us much, as this is still very early days, and the spec details aren’t exactly fully clear either – but the latter is where the juicy nuggets lie. As Tom’s Hardware points out, this processor appears to be a chip with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, and that backs up a previous piece of speculation that the top CPU for Lunar Lake will be a 4+4 configuration here. In other words, what we’re likely seeing is the flagship for Lunar Lake, albeit an early test version of the processor, of course. Further specs detailed include boost speeds running up to 3.9GHz, and a base clock of 1GHz (clearly something to do with this being a sample chip). Power usage is shown at 17W, again aligning with expectations from the rumor mill – remember, this is the flagship CPU in theory, too, which will drain the most power. As we’ve mentioned before, while a 4+4 core count might seem rather disappointing for a contemporary flagship (mobile) CPU, that isn’t really the point with Lunar Lake. These CPUs will seek to carve out relatively peppy performance for their very low power envelope, so they can go in very thin and light laptops , and still be a decent engine for driving everyday computing tasks. All of that seems to be shaping up to happen, and it’s interesting to see that this leaked benchmark backs up the previous rumor about the 4+4 core count. What’s also noteworthy here is that seeing sample processors being benchmarked now suggests that we’ll see Lunar Lake arrive perhaps in a quicker timeframe than past rumors have suggested. We were previously expecting Lunar Lake in late 2024, or maybe early 2025, just after Arrow Lake . But other buzz on the grapevine has hinted that it could arrive alongside Arrow Lake, perhaps – which itself is expected later in 2024. And benchmarks happening already for Lunar Lake seem to back up that theory to some extent. In other words, in about a year’s time, we could well be able to buy Arrow Lake processors and svelte laptops powered by Lunar Lake chips. Everything we keep hearing from Intel about its CPU roadmap is that all future generations are well on track , and this leak does nothing to suggest otherwise, that’s for sure.",

The US economy added 336,000 jobs last month in the highest surge since January, while the jobless rate was unchanged at 3.8 percent, said the Labor Department. This adds to signals that the American job market remains robust despite efforts by the central bank to cool the world's biggest economy and lower inflation sustainably. When the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates and borrowing costs rise, this can dampen hiring associated with business expansion and the jobless rate is generally expected to rise. But for now, the pace of hiring hovers above pre-pandemic levels and unemployment is still around a historically low level, meaning that Fed officials could consider further policy action. Analysts, however, have warned that the job market could weaken going forward, as it takes time for existing policy changes to ripple through the economy. In September, sectors that saw job gains included leisure and hospitality, government as well as health care, said the Labor Department. A factor contributing to the latest increase was the education sector, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics saying in a recent report that they expected a bounce in state and local education after surprisingly weak summer hiring. Apart from the overall acceleration in employment, hiring figures for August and July were also revised upwards by 119,000 combined, the latest Labor Department report added. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent, the same rate as in August. The pick-up in employment is expected to support incomes, and this will likely be of concern to Fed officials as it could feed into consumer demand and inflation. Apart from the steady monthly pay gains figure, economist Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics noted the annual change in earnings was a 4.2 percent increase -- the smallest gain since June 2021. \"A slowing in wage pressures will be welcome news,\" she said. Currently, her expectation remains that there will not be further interest rate hikes this year. But if the labor market continues to strengthen, she cautioned, this would keep the Fed open to raising rates further in 2023. The latest government jobs report comes after figures by payrolls firm ADP released earlier this week showed hiring in the private sector slowed sharply in September. © Copyright AFP 2023.

        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried a Russian missile strike on a small Ukraine hamlet that killed 52 people Thursday, calling the attack one of “absolute evil.” “Russian terrorists launched an attack that one can’t even call beastly. Because it would be an insult to beasts,” Zelensky . “Russian military personnel couldn’t have been unaware of where they were striking. It was not a blind attack. “People had gathered there for a memorial meal, a Christian memorial meal,” he continued. “Who could launch a missile at them? Who? Only absolute evil.” The missile struck near a grocery store and a cafe in the Hroza village, which is in the Kupyansk district of the Kharkiv region. All the victims of the attack were civilians, according to Ukrainian authorities. A young boy was among the dead. Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram that 25 nearby homes were also damaged. Synyehubov added Friday that Russia is continuing to shell the region. The strike was among the deadliest on civilian populations in the war. Moscow denies targeting civilians but acknowledges it carries out frequent strikes to cripple the Ukrainian military. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk “shocked and saddened” by the strike and that “human rights monitors will visit the site to gather information” about the attack. At a briefing, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called it an “incredibly horrifying” attack. “We have to stop and think about this. Let’s stop and think about what we’re seeing: 49 innocent people who were killed by a Russian airstrike while they were shopping for food at a supermarket,” she said Thursday, before the death toll had risen. “That’s what they were doing. “Can you imagine just walking to the grocery store with your kids, trying to figure out what is it that you’re going to make for dinner, and you see an explosion happen where bodies are everywhere?” she continued. “And it’s horrifying. So this is what is happening in Ukraine every day. “This is why we’re doing everything that we can to help Ukraine, to help the brave people of Ukraine to fight for their freedom.”",

        "content": "Austin Maynard Architects is adept at transforming dilapidated homes into attractive modern residences, such as the and projects. The firm recently performed similar magic with its Helvetia, which breathed new life into a traditional terrace house in Melbourne, increasing natural light inside and adding a generous atrium plus multiple garden spaces. Helvetia started out as a family home in the late 19th century before being turned into two dwellings in the 1960s. It was then reconfigured yet again in the 1980s into separate apartments that were dark and uninspired (to its credit, the firm provided photos of the home before its renovation in ). Rather than knock this awkward collection of buildings down and start afresh, the studio kept what it could and worked around the existing structural issues. \"At Helvetia we discovered some serious issues at the core, but no cracks or structural damage to the solid 1960s rear extension,\" explained Austin Maynard Architects. \"Rather than allow our architectural vanity to prevail by tearing down and replacing the (albeit it uninspiring) 60s built form, and encouraged by the owners to limit the carbon footprint, we thought 'why not use the existing brick fabric and work with the skin we've got?' \"The house however, had a problematic area in the middle; a recurring leak in the roof causing water damage, rot and mold to the upstairs bathroom and down into the dining room below. Unlike another of our projects, , which underwent keyhole surgery (minimal invasion for maximum results), Helvetia had a tumor that needed to be cut out. Instead of a scar, we left a beauty spot, the atrium.\" The main entrance has been shifted to a side street and visitors now pass from there into the light-filled atrium, which includes pleasant cooling ponds with fish and lilies. From here, the interior layout of the main home is now much more simple and open, with the galley style kitchen and open living area placed to the right. Two bedrooms are situated to the left, while the owner can also head upstairs to reach a studio/study space, office, and main bedroom. One of the staircases has integrated storage, a bit like we see in tiny houses, and the upper hallway is constructed from perforated metal to help natural light permeate throughout. The landscaping, by Chin Liew, is extensive, and includes a small front-facing garden, a rooftop garden that's enclosed by mesh and accessed from upstairs, a larger rear garden and an \"urban farm.\" This is situated above a garage and accessed by spiral staircase, with a barrel vaulted wire mesh protecting it from possums and other critters. Helvetia's sustainable design is significant. Alongside the decision to retain all possible building materials, a 3,000-liter (roughly 790 gallon) water tank has been buried in the rear garden to store rainwater collected from the roof for flushing toilets and watering the gardens. A 3-kW solar panel system is installed on the roof to reduce the home's grid-based electricity needs. Sustainably sourced timber was used, and insulation was also added where possible. Source:",

The Eras Tour movie is probably expected to be very front-loaded in terms of box-office performance, including pre-sales, as her fans are known to be extreme when it comes to being fast and first. Her fans, known as Swifties, are also extremely passionate and could see the film a number of times, which would help pump up the box office numbers in October and beyond. Swift's shadow looms large, as Blumhouse changed the release date for its new Exorcist movie-- read our review of The Exorcist: Believer --to get out of the way of the Eras Tour movie. It was scheduled to debut on the appropriately spooky date of Friday, October 13, but Blumhouse shifted it up a week to get out of Swift's way. Producer Jason Blum said he is terrified of Taylor Swift. The film is a movie version of Swift's ongoing Eras Tour, which is poised to be one of the most lucrative tours in music history. Swift has more dates across America in October and November, before she goes to South America later in November and then to Japan and Australia in February 2024. After that, the tour heads to Singapore, France, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, London, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Poland, and Austria, before wrapping up in Canada in November 2024.",
