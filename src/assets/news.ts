        "content": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An estimated $1.04 billion Powerball jackpot will be up for grabs Monday night, tempting players to spend a couple dollars on a longshot chance at instant riches. The prize is the world’s ninth-largest lottery prize behind earlier drawings of Powerball and Mega Millions, the other nearly nationwide lottery game. The jackpot is the fourth-largest in the history of Powerball. The prize has grown so massive because there have been 32 consecutive drawings since someone matched all five white balls and the Powerball to win the jackpot, dating back to July 19. That losing streak reflects the stunningly long odds of winning the jackpot, at 1 in 292.2 million. The $1.04 billion jackpot is for a sole winner who chooses to receive the winnings through an annuity, paid annually over 30 years. Winners nearly always pick the cash option, which for Monday night’s drawing would be an estimated $478.2 million. A Powerball ticket costs $2 in most states and players can pick their own numbers or have a computer make the selection. Powerball is played in 45 states as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",

        "description": "Allegations of stalking and harassment have been added to claims Brand raped and sexually assaulted several women at the height of his fame.",
        "content": "Forbes Business Breaking Russell Brand Faces Second Police Investigation Over New Harassment Allegations, Report Says Mary Whitfill Roeloffs Forbes Staff I am a Boston-based reporter covering breaking news. Following Oct 2, 2023, 09:21am EDT | Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline A second police investigation has been opened into comedian and actor Russell Brand, the BBC reported Monday, as the Thames Valley Police in England look into new allegations Brand harassed and stalked a woman between 2018 and 2022—weeks after the comedian was accused of sexual assault in a series of allegations he has denied. Russell Brand attends the Pride of Britain awards at The Grosvenor House Hotel on October 6, 2014 in ... [+] London, England. WireImage Key Facts The investigation is based on \"new information\" that was given to the police by the accuser two weeks ago, the Thames Valley Police—which polices several counties west of London— told the BBC , adding that the new accuser apparently contacted police to report the behavior several times over the five year span, \"but no further action was taken.\" Brand also accused the woman of harassment in 2017, according to the BBC. The Thames Valley Police inquiry is in addition to an investigation launched by the Metropolitan Police in London, which said last week it has received a \"number of allegations of sexual offences,\" pointing to a report by several British news outlets documenting claims of rape and sexual assault against the actor. Brand said in a YouTube video he “absolutely refutes” the \"very serious criminal allegations\" against him, alleging a “coordinated attack” by the media. The Thames Valley Police did not immediately respond to Forbes ’ request for comment Monday. Key Background Four women accused Brand of sexual misconduct in an investigation released September 16 by The Times of London , The Sunday Times and public broadcast station Channel 4. The outlets say they spoke with hundreds of sources to corroborate the allegations, which included a claim by one woman that Brand raped her against a wall in his Los Angeles home in July 2012. Three other women accused him of sexual assault in the initial report and more have come forward since, the Metropolitan Police confirmed . Literary agency Tavistock Wood dropped him as a client in the wake of the scandal, and the Pan Macmillan imprint Bluebird decided to \"pause all future publishing\" with Brand. The BBC has removed some of its programs featuring the comedian, YouTube has blocked him from making money on his 6.6-million-follower channel and stops of his \"Bipolarisation\" comedy tour in the U.K. and Australia have been canceled. The Trevi Women & Children’s Charity, a domestic abuse organization, has also ended its association with Brand and his charity, the addiction-related Stay Free Foundation. Contra Brand has repeatedly and adamantly denied the allegations. He called the claims \"extraordinary and distressing\" in his most recent video on the matter and thanked his supporters for “questioning” the allegations. Brand's father has also spoken up to defend his son and said the media has a \"vendetta\" against him. Brand has credited his father with sparking a sex addiction by paying for him to lose his virginity to a sex worker. The actor has long been open about his addiction struggles and “very very promiscuous\" lifestyle at the height of his fame, but has said all of his relationships were \"absolutely, always consensual.\" Further Reading London Police Investigating Sexual Assault Allegations Against Russell Brand ( Forbes ) Russell Brand Accused Of Exposing Himself To A Woman And Then Laughing About It On Radio ( Forbes ) Russell Brand Fallout Continues: Australian Tour Canceled As YouTube, BBC, Publisher Back Away ( Forbes ) Rumble Slams British Lawmakers Over ‘Disturbing’ Demand To Demonetize Russell Brand After Sexual Assault Allegations ( Forbes ) Follow me on Twitter .

        "description": "In a recent interview, senior developers on Assassin’s Creed Mirage revealed their intention to visit a hugely significant location from the series’ history.",
        "content": "Though Ubisoft’s upcoming stealth action thriller Assassin’s Creed Mirage plans to return the series to its roots by revisiting Baghdad, an interview with senior developers on the title has revealed that the action game will be visiting yet another iconic location from the series’ past. Alamut fortress, in many ways the true home of the Assassins, has been heavily referenced throughout the series but will be visited in Assassin’s Creed Mirage. This detail was revealed in an interview with creative director Stéphane Boudon, art director Jean-Luc Sala, and narrative director Sarah Beaulieu ( via GamesRadar ). For those not in the know, Alamut castle served as one of the earliest Assassin strongholds and has been referenced across the series from Assassin’s Creed Revelations to Assassin’s Creed Valhalla . Given the fortress' location in Qazvin province, Iran, it seems perfect to include, since the region is reasonably close to Baghdad. Beaulieu explained how she “fought for Alamut even though the producer was not happy about it.\" The narrative director went on to say: \"Alamut is big in the Assassin's Creed lore, and I think the community would have been very sad if we had missed that opportunity.\" \"People who know Assassin's Creed know what is in Alamut and what it is,” explained creative director Stéphane Boudon, “but, we've added some stuff, we've created some new stuff – new levels of information about Alamut – and also rethought some of the information that people have on Alamut.” Speaking on the need to address Assassin’s Creed ’s legacy, art director Jean-Luc Sala made it clear that \"our purpose was to make Mirage coherent with the whole franchise.” That said, Boudon was keen to assure fans that Mirage can act as “a standalone story for everyone to play – even if they've not played Valhalla”. With this in mind, it looks as though Mirage will have plenty to offer for fans of the series both old and new. Assassin’s Creed Mirage is coming out on October 5 for PS5 , PS4 , Xbox Series X |S, Xbox One , and PC. Looking for something to play in the meantime?

        "content": "As you may have heard , Adam Copeland is now in AEW after his WWE contract expired on Saturday. He made his debut at WrestleDream last night, saving Sting from an attack by Christian Cage, Luchasaurus and Nick Wayne. In a post on social media, Copeland spoke about why he chose to leave WWE, claiming that the two sides have ‘outgrown each other’ and he wanted to do more than WWE wanted him to do. He also spoke out against tribalism, saying he doesn’t believe in one company versus the other and still plans to watch and support WWE’s wrestlers. He wrote: From The Desk of… As some of you may now know, I’m no longer with WWE. My new home is AEW. I’m excited. Whole new roster. Some familiar faces that I wanted to work with again and a whole set of first ever matches. New challenges, and if you’ve followed my career, you know that’s what I’ve always been driven by. But first and foremost I want to address my 25 years with WWE. I love WWE and appreciate everything the company did for me. Always have, always will. They put me on the map, gave me amazing opportunities and through hard work on both ends, I’ve been supplied with a wonderful life. Hell, WWE helped me meet the woman I’d start my family with. Sometimes relationships just grow apart and I feel the WWE and I have just outgrown each other. I wanted to do more. They didn’t have much more for me to do. Simple as that. And that’s ok. I’ll still be watching and still be supporting all of my friends there. I don’t buy into this odd mentality of one company or the other. It’s weird. If you took offense to that, take a walk, get some fresh air and soak up some sunshine. It’s wrestling. An amazing gig. But still, it’s wrestling. Relax. It’s supposed to be fun. And it’s just a segment of the fans, not most fans, and definitely not the performers. Within the industry we all know that more choices is better for everyone and pushes us all to be better. As a wrestling fan, which I still am, it’s exciting that there’s viable companies providing wrestling on national and worldwide platforms. If you’re actually a fan of wrestling, and not acronyms, that should make you happy too. I guess what I’m trying to say is this, if you’ve appreciated my work, you still can, no matter what the initials are. Because I’ll still be bustin my ass everytime I’m out there. This ride isn’t over just yet. Just try to have fun, like it should be. Because trust me I’ll be having fun everytime I’m out there in an AEW ring. Let’s go!

It’s the first day of Trump’s fraud trial, where a judge will determine how much the former president will have to pay for fudging financial statements over the course of a decade. Trump late Sunday night announced that he would be making an appearance in court the following day, though it is unclear if or when he will ultimately take the witness stand. New York attorney general Letitia James is in attendance for the first day of the trial. James’ three-year investigation into Trump found that he inflated his net worth up by hundreds of millions of dollars and raised the value of his assets on financial statements. James is arguing that Trump should pay up at least $250m in fines. Outside the courthouse early Monday morning, a small group of anti-Trump protestors stood in the middle of the street, chanting “Trump lies all the time”. The trial is scheduled to start at 10 am ET. 5m ago 09.56 EDT Attorney general Letitia James says 'no one is above the law' Before stepping into the courthouse, attorney general Letitia James spoke briefly to reporters.

Photograph: Brittainy Newman/AP 29m ago 09.31 EDT Minutes ago, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign sent out an email attacking Letitia James, the New York state attorney general who sued him and his family, alleging fraud. A judge agreed with her last week, setting the stage for the trial opening today that will determine how much the Trump must pay for inflating their assets in order to secure better loan terms over a period of ten years. In typical Trump form, the email is basically a list of attack on James, including calling her a “Democratic activist” and accusing her of being “soft on crime” and preventing “New York’s police officers from doing their jobs”. James is indeed a Democrat, and if she’s been trying to frustrate the police, evidence suggests she hasn’t been very good at it . 50m ago 09.11 EDT From the Guardian’s Lauren Aratani , here’s more about Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial happening in New York City today, and why it could have major financial consequences for the ex-president and his family: Just a few miles south of Trump Tower in New York City, a judge on Monday will hear allegations of fraud within the Trump Organization in a trial that could see Donald Trump and his family business paying hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and that has already threatened to end his business career in the city where it started. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, has accused Trump of using false and misleading financial statements from 2011 to 2021 to make himself and his businesses wealthier, helping him broker deals and obtain financing. Based on her office’s three-year investigation, James is arguing that Trump owes at least $250m for committing fraud. During the three-year investigation, James found that Trump had exaggerated the value of 23 of his properties and assets to the tune of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Trump used these financial statements to obtain favorable loans and make his net worth appear higher than it actually was. Trump said he will appear in court on Monday. “I’m going to Court tomorrow morning to fight for my name and reputation,” he said on his Truth Social account on Sunday. Trump fraud civil suit starting Monday threatens to end his business career Read more 1h ago 08.55 EDT Trump heads to New York for civil fraud trial that could see business empire dismantled Good morning, US politics blog readers. All eyes will be on a New York City courtroom this morning, where Donald Trump is expected to appear for the start of a trial that will determine the amount he and his children must pay after a judge last week determined they committed fraud . Presided over by New York supreme court justice Arthur Engoron , the trial is scheduled to last until 22 December and the former president is on the witness list, as are his children, meaning they could be called to the stand. The trial is among the many legal entanglements Trump is involved in, none of which appear to have dented his large lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. But the implications for Trump could be damning. If the judge agrees with New York attorney general Letitia James , he could impose a large fine on the former president, and potentially do grievous damage to the business empire Trump used as the platform to launch the political career that brought him to the White House. Here’s what else is happening today: Democrats are caught in the middle as far-right Republicans plan to attempt to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House of Representatives. Do they sign on to the effort, or use it as leverage to save McCarthy, in exchange for major concessions? We’ll hear lots about this today. California has a new senator: Laphonza Butler , the president of abortion rights group EMILY’s list, who governor Gavin Newsom appointed to fill the seat Dianne Feinstein vacated when she died last week. Karine Jean-Pierre will brief the White House press corps at 12.30pm eastern time, and perhaps elaborate on what Joe Biden thinks of all the drama in Congress.

        "content": "close Video Newsom taps Laphonza Butler to replace Dianne Feinstein California Gov. Gavin Newsom chose the Democratic strategist to replace the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein. California Gov. Gavin Newsom , a Democrat, appointed a Democratic strategist and former labor union boss to replace the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Sunday. Newsom tapped Laphonza Butler, the president of EMILY's List — a Democratic political action committee (PAC) dedicated to electing pro-abortion Democratic women to office — for the vacant Senate seat. Butler's EMILY's List biography had her residence listed as Silver Spring, Maryland, earlier Sunday evening, but it was removed from the profile shortly after it was announced she would be appointed to the position. An FEC filing from Aug. 31 also showed a Maryland address.

Gavin Newsom tapped Laphonza Butler, pictured here, the president of EMILY's List — a Democratic political action committee dedicated to electing pro-abortion Democratic women to Congress — for the vacant Senate seat. (AP) EMILY's List describes Butler as \"a leader in Democratic politics, campaign strategy, and the labor movement for two decades\" who has \"dedicated her life to empowering women and supporting them in finding their voice, and using it to make meaningful change.\" According to its website , the progressive PAC's vision includes championing \"diversity as a catalyst for progressive change that makes our country better\" as well as growing their \"millions-strong community of passionate pro-choice supporters nationwide.\" Additionally, EMILY's List touts its commitment to \"Anti-racism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" on an entire page dedicated to the subjects, even going as far as to denote its three percent of \"nonbinary/third gender\" employees . On the page, the PAC includes a \"BIPOC breakdown\" of the different races of their employees, which includes \"Latinx\" — a term reportedly heavily disfavored by the Latino community.

Before joining the pro-abortion PAC, Butler worked as North American public policy director of Airbnb and as a senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris' failed 2020 presidential campaign. Butler got her start in politics by supporting labor unions, eventually becoming the union president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 2015 in California.

(Emily's List) When reached for comment, EMILY's List pointed Fox News Digital to its press release earlier Monday, in which board Chair Rebecca Haile described Butler as a \"groundbreaking leader.\" \"EMILYs List was created to get more Democratic pro-choice women in government, and I am thrilled to see my friend put that into action by taking on this role,\" Haile said. \"As a labor leader, the only Black woman in the Senate and the first Black LGBTQ+ senator, I know Laphonza will bring all of us into the Senate with her as she does the critical work of ensuring our government works for and represents all of us.\" Butler will finish out the remainder of Feinstein's term in Washington, D.C., ahead of the 2024 election. In a statement, the governor described Butler as an \"advocate for women and girls, a second-generation fighter for working people, and a trusted adviser to Vice President Harris.\" \"As we mourn the enormous loss of Senator Feinstein, the very freedoms she fought for — reproductive freedom, equal protection, and safety from gun violence — have never been under greater assault,\" Newsom added. \"Laphonza will carry the baton left by Senator Feinstein, continue to break glass ceilings, and fight for all Californians in Washington D.C.\" Butler will be the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate and the first openly LGBTQ+ lawmaker to represent the Golden State in the upper chamber. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Newsom previously vowed to place a Black woman in any Senate seat that became vacant — a promise that was criticized by U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., who said the Democrat governor's pledge was \"insulting\" to Black women, since the appointment would be temporary ahead of the primary. Butler's appointment came days after Feinstein's death on Thursday at the age of 90. Fox News Digital's Landon Mion and Lee Ross contributed reporting.

        "content": "“ Million Dollar Listing UAE,” the first adaptation outside the U.S. of Bravo’s long-running luxury real estate reality franchise, is going through the roof in the Middle East. The bilingual show, featuring five United Arab Emirates brokers wheeling and dealing lavish properties in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, has been breaking all previous viewership records “across originals as well as licensed shows” since its Sept. 15 launch on subscription streamer Starzplay Arabia, says its CEO Maaz Sheikh. In hindsight “it’s a no brainer” says Ben Ross, acting CEO of Image Nation Abu Dhabi, the government-owned studio that decided to license the show from NBCUniversal Formats after being approached by veteran Dubai-based real estate agent Ben Bandari, who initially tried to get the remake rights himself. Image Nation then brought it to Starzplay. Until recently, Bandari’s claim to fame was achieving property sales exceeding 20 billion Dirhams ($5 billion). He now stars on “ Million Dollar Listing UAE ” along with agents Zay Brown, who is from the U.K. and is the show’s youngest broker; Nassira Sekkay, who drives a yellow Ferrari – she is known as “The Shark”; Rami Wahood, who sells units in Dubai’s Burji Khalifa, the world’s tallest sky scraper; and the perpetually smiling Riad Gohar, co-founder of Dubai’s BlackOak Real Estate whose moniker is “The Charmer.” “Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles” star Josh Altman (pictured, above) and his brother, Matt, also feature in the first episodes of “Million Dollar Listing UAE,” creating a cultural bridge of sorts. For the UAE version, Image Nation consulted closely with the original format’s U.S. production company World of Wonder. “We got their notes, we got their guidelines, and they even sent out their post-production producer towards the end of the shoot,” Ross recounts. But what grabbed Starzplay from the get-go about bringing this Emmy-nominated piece of U.S. pop culture to the Arab world “was the hyper localization of it,” says Sheikh. “The fact that the show would be a product of what’s happening in the UAE and that the talent and cast would essentially be people from this part of the world. That was extremely attractive to us,” he explains. Sheikh noted that 20 years ago the UAE became the first country in the Gulf region to open up to allowing foreigners to own real estate. Now Dubai is the world’s top market for prime real estate thanks to a rush of new buyers, including from Russia, that prompted prices to skyrocket 225% in the last quarter after hitting a pandemic low during the third quarter of 2020, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank. By contrast, the U.S. luxury housing market bubble has burst with transactions recently dropping more than 24% in New York City and Los Angeles, according to brokerage Redfin. That’s why these days real estate “Is more engrained in the fabric of society and a topic of dinner conversations in this part of the world than anywhere else,” Sheikh points out. The local real estate boom’s relevancy is also reflected in the geographic breakdown of the current success of “Million Dollar Listing UAE” on Starzplay, which according to Sheikh comes almost 50% from subscribers in the UAE alone, while another 30% comes from Saudi Arabia and the rest is from customers in the 17 other markets across the Middle East and North Africa where the service operates. But “Million Dollar Listing UAE” now has even bigger ambitions. Since Dubai is “top of mind globally,” as Sheikh puts it, Image Nation and Starzplay are now confident they will soon find international distribution outlets for the first non-U.S. “Million Dollar Listing” iteration. Meanwhile, auditions are underway in Dubai for the show’s second season.",
